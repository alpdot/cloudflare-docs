# Get started

There are two ways to build your Workers AI projects on Cloudflare: with a Cloudflare Worker or the Workers AI API.

Choose a guide to get started on your first project:

{{<directory-listing showDescriptions="true" >}}

After you have built your first Workers AI project, go to [Models](/workers-ai/models/) to review what other inference tasks you can accomplish with Workers AI.


User creates an AI binding.
User writes or copies template code that calls the model.
User sets up `wrangler.toml` for project to point to the right zone.
User deploys Worker to Cloudflare global network.
User tests using local development.
